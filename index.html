<h1> About </h1>
<p>
My name is Siddiq Ahmed Syed. I am Oracle certified Java SE 7 developer, graduated with MS in Computer Science with 3.86/4.00 from SJSU. I consider myself result-oriented,always excited to learn new technologies and inclined to develop new things for the betterment of society. My experience varies from startups to mid size companies. During my undergrad I created an online service that served my community(which earned notice by our local media). By doing so, I gained experience about product development from inception to product delivery.I like working in a team as I consider this a great opportunity to learn from others.
